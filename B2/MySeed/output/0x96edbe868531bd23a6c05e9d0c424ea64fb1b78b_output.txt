Here is the analysis of the `PENNY_BY_PENNY` contract based on the provided requirements:

### 1. List of Function Names
```json
[
    "SetMinSum",
    "SetLogFile",
    "Initialized",
    "Put",
    "Collect",
    "()"
]
```

### 2. Dataflow Analysis
The dataflow can be identified as follows:

- `SetMinSum` modifies the state variable `MinSum`.
- `Put` uses the state variable `MinSum` in its logic (specifically in the `Collect` function).
- `Collect` checks the `MinSum` value and also modifies the `balance` of the `Holder` struct.

Thus, the dataflow can be represented as:
```json
[
    "SetMinSum->Put->Collect"
]
```

### 3. Generated Sequences
Based on the identified dataflow, the corresponding sequence of function calls is as follows:

- The `SetMinSum` function sets the minimum sum.
- The `Put` function allows a user to deposit funds, which updates the `balance`.
- The `Collect` function allows the user to withdraw funds, which checks against `MinSum` and modifies the `balance`.

The sequence of function calls is:
```json
[
    "SetMinSum(1),Put(1),Collect(1)"
]
```

### Final Result in JSON Format
Here is the complete result in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "functions": [
        "SetMinSum",
        "SetLogFile",
        "Initialized",
        "Put",
        "Collect",
        "()"
    ],
    "dataflow": [
        "SetMinSum->Put->Collect"
    ],
    "sequence": [
        "SetMinSum(1),Put(1),Collect(1)"
    ]
}
```
['"SetMinSum(1),Put(1),Collect(1)"']
