Here is the analysis of the `SimpleDAO` contract based on the provided requirements:

1. **List of Function Names**:
   ```json
   [
     "donate",
     "withdraw",
     "queryCredit"
   ]
   ```

2. **Dataflow**:
   - The `donate` function modifies the `credit` mapping for the `to` address.
   - The `withdraw` function checks the `credit` mapping for `msg.sender` to ensure that the amount to withdraw is available.
   - The `queryCredit` function reads the `credit` mapping for a specified address but does not modify it.

   The dataflow can be represented as:
   - `donate -> withdraw`

3. **Generated Sequences**:
   - The sequence of function calls based on the dataflow found is:
   ```json
   [
     "donate(1), withdraw(1)"
   ]
   ```

Here is the complete result in JSON format:

```json
{
  "functions": [
    "donate",
    "withdraw",
    "queryCredit"
  ],
  "dataflow": [
    "donate -> withdraw"
  ],
  "sequence": [
    "donate(1), withdraw(1)"
  ]
}
```
['"donate(1), withdraw(1)"']
