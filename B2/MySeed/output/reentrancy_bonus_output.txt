Here is the analysis of the `Reentrancy_bonus` contract based on your requirements:

1. **List of Function Names:**
```json
[
    "withdrawReward",
    "getFirstWithdrawalBonus",
    "fallback"
]
```

2. **Dataflow:**
```json
[
    "getFirstWithdrawalBonus->withdrawReward->getFirstWithdrawalBonus"
]
```

3. **Sequence:**
```json
[
    "getFirstWithdrawalBonus(0x1),withdrawReward(0x1)"
]
```

### Explanation:
- **Function Names:** The contract contains three functions: `withdrawReward`, `getFirstWithdrawalBonus`, and a fallback function (which is unnamed but is represented as `fallback`).
  
- **Dataflow:** The dataflow indicates that when `getFirstWithdrawalBonus` is called, it modifies the state (specifically `claimedBonus` and `rewardsForA`) and then calls `withdrawReward`. The `withdrawReward` function can potentially call back into `getFirstWithdrawalBonus` if the recipient is a contract that calls it again, leading to a reentrancy vulnerability.

- **Sequence:** The sequence represents the order of function calls based on the identified dataflow. The parameters are represented as addresses, and since the contract does not specify any particular addresses, I used `0x1` as a placeholder. 

This structure adheres to your request for a JSON format output containing the function names, dataflow, and sequences.
