To analyze the `MultiplicatorX4` contract and extract the required information, we will follow the steps outlined in your request.

### Step 1: List of Functions
We will identify all the functions in the contract.

1. `function() public payable`
2. `function withdraw() payable public`
3. `function Command(address adr, bytes data) payable public`
4. `function multiplicate(address adr) public payable`

### Step 2: Identify Dataflows
Next, we will analyze the functions to find the data flows. 

- **Dataflow 1**: 
  - `withdraw` uses `Owner` to check if the caller is the owner and transfers the contract's balance.
  - `Command` also checks if the caller is the owner and then calls another contract with the provided address and data.
  - `multiplicate` checks the value sent and transfers funds to the specified address if the condition is met.

The data flow can be summarized as:
- `withdraw -> Command`
- `withdraw -> multiplicate`

### Step 3: Generate Sequences
Now we will generate sequences based on the identified data flows.

1. For the data flow `withdraw -> Command`:
   - Sequence: `withdraw(), Command(adr, data)`

2. For the data flow `withdraw -> multiplicate`:
   - Sequence: `withdraw(), multiplicate(adr)`

### Final Result in JSON Format
Now we will format the results in the required JSON format.

```json
{
  "functions": [
    "function() public payable",
    "function withdraw() payable public",
    "function Command(address adr, bytes data) payable public",
    "function multiplicate(address adr) public payable"
  ],
  "dataflow": [
    "withdraw->Command",
    "withdraw->multiplicate"
  ],
  "sequence": [
    "withdraw(), Command(1, 0)",
    "withdraw(), multiplicate(1)"
  ]
}
```

### Notes:
- In the sequences, I used `1` for the address parameter and `0` for the bytes data parameter, assuming these are the default values as per your instructions.
- The sequences are based on the identified data flows and the functions available in the contract.
['"withdraw(), Command(1, 0)",\n    "withdraw(), multiplicate(1)"']
