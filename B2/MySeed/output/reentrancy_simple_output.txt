Here is the analysis of the `Reentrance` contract based on the provided snippet:

### 1. List of Function Names
```json
{
  "functions": [
    "getBalance",
    "addToBalance",
    "withdrawBalance"
  ]
}
```

### 2. Dataflow
The dataflow can be identified as follows:
- `addToBalance` modifies `userBalance[msg.sender]`.
- `withdrawBalance` uses `userBalance[msg.sender]` to send ether to `msg.sender`.

Thus, the dataflow is:
```json
{
  "dataflow": [
    "addToBalance->withdrawBalance"
  ]
}
```

### 3. Sequences
Based on the identified dataflow, the sequence of function calls can be generated as follows:
- The `addToBalance` function is called to add to the user's balance, followed by `withdrawBalance` to withdraw that balance.

The sequence is:
```json
{
  "sequence": [
    "addToBalance(1),withdrawBalance()"
  ]
}
```

### Final Result in JSON Format
Combining all the above information, the final result is as follows:
```json
{
  "functions": [
    "getBalance",
    "addToBalance",
    "withdrawBalance"
  ],
  "dataflow": [
    "addToBalance->withdrawBalance"
  ],
  "sequence": [
    "addToBalance(1),withdrawBalance()"
  ]
}
```
['"addToBalance(1),withdrawBalance()"']
