Here is the analysis of the `SimpleWallet` contract based on your requirements:

1. **List of Function Names**:
   ```json
   [
       "function()",
       "withdrawAll()",
       "withdraw(uint _value)",
       "sendMoney(address _target, uint _value, bytes _data)"
   ]
   ```

2. **Dataflow**:
   - The `withdrawAll()` function calls `withdraw(address(this).balance)`, which uses the variable `address(this).balance` that is affected by the deposits made through the fallback function `function()`.
   - The `withdraw(uint _value)` function is called by `withdrawAll()`, and it uses the `_value` parameter which is derived from `address(this).balance`.

   Therefore, the dataflow can be represented as:
   ```json
   [
       "function()->withdrawAll()->withdraw(uint _value)"
   ]
   ```

3. **Generated Sequences**:
   - The sequence of function calls based on the identified dataflow is:
   ```json
   [
       "function(),withdrawAll(),withdraw(0)"
   ]
   ```

   Note: The `withdraw(0)` is used here as a placeholder since `address(this).balance` is not directly accessible in the sequence but is implied to be the balance of the contract at the time of the call.

Here is the final result in JSON format:

```json
{
   "functions": [
       "function()",
       "withdrawAll()",
       "withdraw(uint _value)",
       "sendMoney(address _target, uint _value, bytes _data)"
   ],
   "dataflow": [
       "function()->withdrawAll()->withdraw(uint _value)"
   ],
   "sequence": [
       "function(),withdrawAll(),withdraw(0)"
   ]
}
```
['"function(),withdrawAll(),withdraw(0)"']
