To analyze the data flow in the `WedIndex` contract, we need to identify how variables are used across different functions. The relevant functions in the `WedIndex` contract are `writeIndex` and `numberOfIndex`. The `writeIndex` function modifies the state by pushing a new `IndexArray` struct into the `indexarray`, which contains the `indexdate`, `wedaddress`, `partnernames`, `weddingdate`, and `displaymultisig`. The `numberOfIndex` function reads the length of the `indexarray`.

### Data Flow Analysis
1. **Data Flow**: 
   - `writeIndex` modifies the state by adding an entry to `indexarray`.
   - `numberOfIndex` reads the state of `indexarray`.

Thus, the data flow can be represented as:
```
writeIndex -> numberOfIndex
```

### Function Call Sequence
To implement this data flow, we can create a sequence of function calls. The `writeIndex` function will be called first to modify the state, followed by `numberOfIndex` to read the updated state.

The parameters for `writeIndex` can be represented as follows:
- `indexdate`: 1 (assuming a placeholder value)
- `wedaddress`: "address" (assuming a placeholder string)
- `partnernames`: "partners" (assuming a placeholder string)
- `weddingdate`: 1 (assuming a placeholder value)
- `displaymultisig`: 1 (assuming a placeholder value)

The sequence of function calls will be:
```
writeIndex(1, "address", "partners", 1, 1), numberOfIndex()
```

### JSON Output
Here is the result in JSON format:

```json
{
  "dataflow": [
    "writeIndex->numberOfIndex"
  ],
  "sequence": [
    "writeIndex(1, \"address\", \"partners\", 1, 1), numberOfIndex()"
  ]
}
``` 

This output captures the identified data flow and the corresponding sequence of function calls that reflect the data dependencies.
['"writeIndex(1, \\"address\\", \\"partners\\", 1, 1), numberOfIndex()"']
