Here is the analysis of the `ACCURAL_DEPOSIT` contract based on the provided requirements:

### 1. List of Function Names
```json
[
    "SetMinSum",
    "SetLogFile",
    "Initialized",
    "Deposit",
    "Collect",
    "()"
]
```

### 2. Dataflow Analysis
The dataflow can be identified as follows:

- `SetMinSum` modifies the state variable `MinSum`.
- `Deposit` modifies the mapping `balances` for the sender.
- `Collect` checks the value of `balances` and `MinSum` before executing a call and modifying `balances`.

The dataflow can be represented as:
- `SetMinSum -> Deposit -> Collect`

### 3. Generated Sequences
Based on the identified dataflow, the corresponding sequences of function calls are:

```json
[
    "SetMinSum(1),Deposit(),Collect(1)"
]
```

### Final Result in JSON Format
Here is the complete result in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "functions": [
        "SetMinSum",
        "SetLogFile",
        "Initialized",
        "Deposit",
        "Collect",
        "()"
    ],
    "dataflow": [
        "SetMinSum -> Deposit -> Collect"
    ],
    "sequence": [
        "SetMinSum(1),Deposit(),Collect(1)"
    ]
}
``` 

This output captures the functions, the identified dataflow, and the corresponding sequences as per your request.
['"SetMinSum(1),Deposit(),Collect(1)"']
