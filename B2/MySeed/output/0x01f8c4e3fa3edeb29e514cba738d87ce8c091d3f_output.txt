Here is the analysis of the `PERSONAL_BANK` contract based on the provided requirements:

### 1. List of Function Names
```json
{
  "functions": [
    "SetMinSum",
    "SetLogFile",
    "Initialized",
    "Deposit",
    "Collect"
  ]
}
```

### 2. Dataflow Analysis
The dataflow can be observed as follows:

- `SetMinSum` modifies the state variable `MinSum`.
- `Deposit` modifies the mapping `balances` for the sender's address.
- `Collect` checks the value of `MinSum` and the sender's balance in `balances` before executing a call to transfer funds.

The dataflow can be represented as:
- `SetMinSum -> Deposit -> Collect`

### 3. Generated Sequences
Based on the identified dataflow, the corresponding sequences of function calls are:

```json
{
  "dataflow": [
    "SetMinSum->Deposit->Collect"
  ],
  "sequences": [
    "SetMinSum(1), Deposit(), Collect(1)"
  ]
}
```

### Final JSON Result
Combining all the information, the final result in JSON format is:

```json
{
  "functions": [
    "SetMinSum",
    "SetLogFile",
    "Initialized",
    "Deposit",
    "Collect"
  ],
  "dataflow": [
    "SetMinSum->Deposit->Collect"
  ],
  "sequences": [
    "SetMinSum(1), Deposit(), Collect(1)"
  ]
}
``` 

This result captures the functions, the identified dataflow, and the corresponding sequences based on the analysis of the `PERSONAL_BANK` contract.
