This is a json object and can not be decoded into the json format,

`input`

which means it is wrong as json object.
You should check out which mistake you have made, I can give you two answers:
1.This json object is incomplete.Here `incomplete` means it is a json object originally, but because of the limitation of the output length, it was not fully input into the file, so it is incomplete.
2.This json object contains some error that can be decoded.
If you think the reason is the first, then please return the "incomplete".
If you think the reason is the second, then please modify the wrong result according to the json format.If you modify your result, please delete the `reason` key,
but do not increase or decrease the length of the json array that corresponding to the key `res`.

So, in summary, you should return a json object to me.
One key is `reason`, the value corresponding to this key you can choose is "first" and "second",
another key is `result`, the value corresponding to this key can be divided into the following situations:
1. if the reason is `first`, then this value should be "null" string.
2. if the reason is `second`, then this value should be the modified json object which can be decoded as json object.
