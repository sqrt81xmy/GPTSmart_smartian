Now your generated json result can not be decoded into the json format,
which means your result is wrong as json object.
You should check out which mistake you have made, I can give you two answers:
1.Your output result is incomplete.
2.Your result contains some error that can be decoded.
If you think the reason is the first, then please return the "incomplete".
If you think the reason is the second, then please modify the wrong result according to the json format and my standard about the function sequence result in the context.

So, in summary, you should return a json object to me.
One key is `reason`, the value corresponding to this key you can choose is "first" and "second",
another key is `result`, the value corresponding to this key can be divided into the following situations:
1. if the reason is `first`, then this value should be "null" string.
2. if the reason is `second`, then this value should be the modified json object which can be decoded as json object.
